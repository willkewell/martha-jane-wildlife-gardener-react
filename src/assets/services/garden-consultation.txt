If you're looking for some inspiration but don't want to commit to a full planting plan or just want some pointers on how to manage your garden I offer a garden consultation service. This begins with a 1-2 hour consultation where I will come and visit you in your garden to talk about your wants and ideas, problem areas and tips on managing your space to help reach its full potential. I will then follow this up with a summary of the points mentioned during the consultation and steps moving forward. I always aim for this to inspire you to take on your garden yourself but equally this consultation can be developed into a planting plan or maintenance services from myself if you desire.
