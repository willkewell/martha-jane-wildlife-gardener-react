If you want some help planning your beds and borders, I offer personalised planting plans specializing in wildlife gardens, naturalistic planting styles and food forests and vegetable beds. I will come out for an initial consultation with you around the garden to talk about your wants, ideas and inspirations, followed by a site survey. I will then follow up with mood boards for each season and a plant list to give you an idea of the final result, at this stage anything can be tweaked if needed. After this I will produce a plant schedule, a sketch for plant positioning and a year round maintenance plan. If you desire, I am always more than happy to do the planting as well at my garden maintenance rate. This service can also be combined with my soft landscaping service if you're looking to add a new area to your garden or reshape your beds.
